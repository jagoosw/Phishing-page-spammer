# Phishing-page-spammer

Quickly put together script to spam a phising site posing as a UK tax return page attempting to collect card details.

After 1000 submissions I emailed their hosting provider and very shortly after the page was taken downm hopefuly due to one of the measures.

Note: you need to download a file of postcodes from somewhere, I used this one https://www.doogal.co.uk/files/postcodes.zip but the file is too big to upload here.
